[1] Rework compiler `prev_bytes` to accurately count size of instruction. Could maybe do a two pass, one write one patch phase thing?
The idea would be to go through like by line and build the binary output for 
each line. Whenever we encounter a label, we mark the index, fill with zeroes, 
and move on. Then afterwards we go back to each one of those spots and patch the
address with where we found the label defined. If a label does not have a 
defined address then we can let the user know and fail out  
[2] Update logging to use proper macros
[3] Rework Results to use custom error codes, etc
[4] Create more interrupts
[5] Fix compiler
    [a] Make compiler more adaptable
